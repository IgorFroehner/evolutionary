# N Queens Example

This example shows how to use the `evolutionary` library to solve the N Queens problem.

The N Queens problem is a classic problem in which you have to place N queens on a NxN chessboard such that no queen 
can attack another queen. This means that no two queens can be on the same row, column, or diagonal.
